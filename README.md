# Swiss-Army-Solutions_SafeTravels
A school project to make short distance navigation for blind or visual impaired people easier. The system is based on a Arduino Lilypad and will measure distance up to 4 meters from the user. If a user is near a wall or obstacle a bracelet will vibrate to indicate to the user that they are nearing an obstacle.
